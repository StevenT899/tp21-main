; pytest.ini

; Description:
;   Pytest configuration file for controlling test discovery and reporting behavior.
;   This setup ensures that all test files in the `api/` directory matching `test_*.py`
;   will be executed, and results are saved in a standalone HTML report.

[pytest]
testpaths = api                      ; Look for tests inside the 'api' subdirectory
python_files = test_*.py            ; Discover files prefixed with 'test_'
addopts = -v                        ; Run in verbose mode
          --html=test_report.html   ; Output test results to an HTML file
          --self-contained-html     ; Ensure the HTML report is standalone and portable
